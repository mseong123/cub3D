# 42KL - cub3D

`cub3d` is a 42 school team project to render a 2D map into a 3D viewport using raycasting algorithm (like [Wolfenstein 3D](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) which was the first FPS ever). The project is implemented using the [MiniLibX library](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).
